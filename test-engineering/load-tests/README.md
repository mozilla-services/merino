# load-tests

This directory contains source code for load tests for Merino.

**Please note that this is work in progress.** ðŸš§

## Run tests locally

You can run the load tests locally from the repository root directory using:

```text
docker-compose -f test-engineering/load-tests/docker-compose.yml up --scale locust_worker=4
```

# Run distributed load tests on GCP

You can run the distributed load tests from the repository root directory using the bash script ```load_test_setup.sh``` using cloud shell.


Make the file executable by:

```text
chmod +X load_test_setup.sh
```

then, run the file:

```text
load_test_setup.sh
```

Wait for the External_IP to be generated, it takes a few seconds, run a watch loop while an external IP address is assigned to the Locust master service:

```text
kubectl get svc locust-master --watch
```

Press Ctrl+C to exit the watch loop and then run the following command to note the external IP address:

```text
EXTERNAL_IP=$(kubectl get svc locust-master -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}")
```

```text
echo $EXTERNAL_IP
```

Open your browser and then open the Locust master web interface http://$EXTERNAL_IP:8089"

To modify the number of workers to say 20, run:

```text
kubectl scale deployment/locust-worker --replicas=20
```

Currently, it's set to run 10 workers but it can be changed by running above command.
