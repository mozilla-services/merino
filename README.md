A service to provide address bar suggestions to Firefox. For more details, see
the [service docs](https://mozilla-services.github.io/merino/).

## About the Name

This project drives an important part of Firefox's "felt experience". That is,
the feeling of using Firefox, hopefully in a delightful way. The word "felt" in
this phrase refers to feeling, but it can be punned to refer to the
[textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felt). Felt is often made of wool, and
Merino wool (from Merino sheep) produces exceptionally smooth felt.
