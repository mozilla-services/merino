# Merino

A service to provide address bar suggestions to Firefox from a variety of sources.

## About the Name

This project drives an important part of Firefox's "felt experience". That
is, the feeling of using Firefox, hopefully in a delightful way. The word
"felt" in this phrase refers to feeling, but it can be punned to refer to the
[textile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felt). Felt is often made of wool,
and Merino wool (from Merino sheep) produces exceptionally smooth felt.
