/// Run a test with a fully configured Merino server.
///
/// The server will listen on a port assigned arbitrarily by the OS.
///
/// A suite of tools will be passed to the test function in the form of an
/// instance of [`TestingTools`]. It includes an HTTP client configured to use
/// the test server, an HTTP mock server that Remote Settings has been configured
/// to read from, and a log collector that can make assertions about logs that
/// were printed.
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```
/// # use merino_integration_tests::{merino_test, TestingTools};
/// #[actix_rt::test]
/// async fn a_test() {
///     merino_test(
///         |settings| settings.debug = false,
///         |TestingTools { test_client, mut log_watcher, .. }| async move {
///             assert!(true) // Test goes here
///         }
///     ).await
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Panics
/// May panic if tests could not be set up correctly.
