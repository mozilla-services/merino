<p>While the other parts of documentation are useful to users of the crate, this part is probably
helpful only if you want to look into the code or are curious about how it works internally.</p>
<p>Also note that any of these details may change in future versions and are not part of the
stability guarantees. Don’t rely on anything here.</p>
<h1 id="storing-the-arc" class="section-header"><a href="#storing-the-arc">Storing the <code>Arc</code>.</a></h1>
<p>The <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/sync/struct.Arc.html"><code>Arc</code></a> can be turned into a raw pointer and back. This is abstracted by the <a href="../../trait.RefCnt.html"><code>RefCnt</code></a>
trait and it is technically possible to implement it for custom types (this crate also
implements it for <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/rc/struct.Rc.html"><code>Rc</code></a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/sync/struct.Weak.html"><code>Weak</code></a>, though the actual usefulness of these is a bit
questionable).</p>
<p>The raw pointer is stored inside an <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicPtr.html"><code>AtomicPtr</code></a>.</p>
<h1 id="protection-of-reference-counts" class="section-header"><a href="#protection-of-reference-counts">Protection of reference counts</a></h1>
<p>The first idea would be to just use <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/sync/atomic/struct.AtomicPtr.html"><code>AtomicPtr</code></a> with whatever the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/alloc/sync/struct.Arc.html#method.into_raw"><code>Arc::into_raw</code></a> returns.
Then replacing it would be fine (there’s no need to update ref counts). The load needs to
increment the reference count ‒ one still stays inside and another is returned to the caller.
This is done by re-creating the Arc from the raw pointer and then cloning it, throwing one
instance away (without destroying it).</p>
<p>This approach has a problem. There’s a short time between we read the raw pointer and increment
the count. If some other thread replaces the stored Arc and throws it away, the ref count could
drop to 0, get destroyed and we would be trying to bump ref counts in a ghost, which would be
totally broken.</p>
<p>To prevent this, we actually use two approaches in a hybrid manner.</p>
<p>The first one is based on hazard pointers idea, but slightly modified. There’s a global
repository of pointers that owe a reference. When someone swaps a pointer, it walks this list
and pays all the debts (and takes them out of the repository).</p>
<p>For simplicity and performance, storing into the repository is fallible. If storing into the
repository fails (because the thread used up all its own slots, or because the pointer got
replaced in just the wrong moment and it can’t confirm the reservation), unlike the full
hazard-pointers approach, we don’t retry, but fall back onto secondary strategy.</p>
<p>The secondary strategy is similar, but a bit more complex (and therefore slower, that’s why it
is only a fallback). We first publish an intent to read a pointer (and where we are reading it
from). Then we actually do so and publish the debt, like previously.</p>
<p>The writer pays the debts as usual. But also, if it sees the intent to read the value, it helps
along, reads it, bumps the reference and passes it to the reader. Therefore, if the reader
fails to do the protection itself, because it got interrupted by a writer, it finds a
ready-made replacement value it can just use and doesn’t have to retry. Also, the writer
doesn’t have to wait for the reader in any way, because it can just solve its problem and move
on.</p>
<h1 id="unsafety" class="section-header"><a href="#unsafety">Unsafety</a></h1>
<p>All the uses of the unsafe keyword is just to turn the raw pointer back to Arc. It originated
from an Arc in the first place, so the only thing to ensure is it is still valid. That means its
ref count never dropped to 0.</p>
<p>At the beginning, there’s ref count of 1 stored in the raw pointer (and maybe some others
elsewhere, but we can’t rely on these). This 1 stays there for the whole time the pointer is
stored there. When the arc is replaced, this 1 is returned to the caller, so we just have to
make sure no more readers access it by that time.</p>
<h1 id="leases-and-debts" class="section-header"><a href="#leases-and-debts">Leases and debts</a></h1>
<p>Instead of incrementing the reference count, the pointer reference can be owed. In such case, it
is recorded into a global storage. As each thread has its own storage (the global storage is
composed of multiple thread storages), the readers don’t contend. When the pointer is no longer
in use, the debt is erased.</p>
<p>The writer pays all the existing debts, therefore the reader have the full Arc with ref count at
that time. The reader is made aware the debt was paid and decrements the reference count.</p>
<h1 id="memory-orders" class="section-header"><a href="#memory-orders">Memory orders</a></h1><h2 id="synchronizing-the-data-pointed-to-by-the-pointer" class="section-header"><a href="#synchronizing-the-data-pointed-to-by-the-pointer">Synchronizing the data pointed to by the pointer.</a></h2>
<p>We have AcqRel (well, SeqCst, but that’s included) on the swap and Acquire on the loads. In case
of the double read around the debt allocation, we do that on the <em>second</em>, because of ABA.
That’s also why that SeqCst on the allocation of debt itself is not enough.
the <em>latest</em> decrement. By making both the increment and decrement AcqRel, we effectively chain
the edges together.</p>
<h1 id="memory-orders-around-debts" class="section-header"><a href="#memory-orders-around-debts">Memory orders around debts</a></h1>
<p>The linked list of debt nodes only grows. The shape of the list (existence of nodes) is
synchronized through Release on creation and Acquire on load on the head pointer.</p>
<p>The debts work similar to locks ‒ Acquire and Release make all the pointer manipulation at the
interval where it is written down. However, we use the SeqCst on the allocation of the debt
because when we see an empty slot, we need to make sure that it happened after we have
overwritten the pointer.</p>
<p>In case the writer pays the debt, it sees the new enough data (for the same reasons the stale
empties are not seen). The reference count on the Arc is AcqRel and makes sure it is not
destroyed too soon. The writer traverses all the slots, therefore they don’t need to synchronize
with each other.</p>
<p>Further details are inside the internal <code>debt</code> module.</p>
