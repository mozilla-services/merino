This is generally a quite useless function as this functionality is nicely wrapped through the `Cmd` object, but in some cases it can be useful.  The return value of this can then be send to the low level `ConnectionLike` methods."],["parse_redis_url","This function takes a redis URL string and parses it into a URL as used by rust-url.  This is necessary as the default parser does not understand how redis URLs function."],["parse_redis_value","Parses bytes into a redis value."],["parse_redis_value_async","Parses a redis value asynchronously."],["pipe","Shortcut for creating a new pipeline."],["transaction","This function simplifies transaction management slightly.  What it does is automatically watching keys and then going into a transaction loop util it succeeds.
